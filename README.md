# sunrise_sunset

See the Wikipedia page on the [sunrise equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_equation)

Here we've implemented the equation in JavaScript, and the code kinda sorta seems to work.

Kinda sorta!

## Why even do this?

I had an app on my phone for this, but it hasn't been updated in forever and you can't even get it anymore.

Let's recreate the halcyon days of having a app that just states sunrise and sunset times, with no other garbage.

## To do:

* Ask user for location and use that to populate lat/lon
* Alternatively, figure out approximately where the user is using some other metadata
* Push the output to the webpage instead of to the console
* Fancy CSS theme
* Daylight hours calculation
* Maybe some sort of clickable map thing, like in Windows setup
* Or a list of cities...
